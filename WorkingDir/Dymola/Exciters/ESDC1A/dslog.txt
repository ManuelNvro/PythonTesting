Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dassault Systemes))
Error: The following error was detected at time: 2.15

Model error - power: (constantLoad.v) ^ (constantLoad.b2-2.0) = (0) ^ (-0.231)

First evaluation failed for non-linear solver.

Error: The following error was detected at time: 2.15

Model error - power: (constantLoad.v) ^ (constantLoad.b2-2.0) = (0) ^ (-0.231)

Non-linear solver will attempt to handle this problem.
